# Shopping-Mall-Billing-System
It is my 3rd semester DSA Project. It is billing system which allows the user to select the items they want to buy, print the bill and avail different services given by the store.
This is a menu driven made with makefile for easy working and user friendly instructions are provided. In this project , I have used hash data structures .

This shopping mall billing system is made to cater to the needs of both customers and well as the mall owner. 

The customers can view the ongoing offers in the shopping mall, the items available and their details.They can specify their mode of payment, number of polybags required and avail facilties like home delivery and give their valuable feedback. There is an optional points based card system in which the user gets certain discounts upon collection of a fixed number of points. The users can anytime view their card details and delete their aaccount.

The mart owner can view the details of all the earnings, the number of customers visited and the overall feedback given to the mall. The written feedback file and the home delivery files are also maintained which stores information about the items to be delivered and the customer.
